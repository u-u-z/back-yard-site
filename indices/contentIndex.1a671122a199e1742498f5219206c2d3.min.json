Request / Input by devices or networking.\n2. Read the program from RAM, execute on CPU, save results in RAM (part for save result).\n3. Save results to RAM or HDD/SSD storage, or send throw network devices, or output to device.\n4. repeat 1 ⬆️\n\nThese meaningful steps for user, we call that **the program**. There r Applications, middlewares, and OS program for users.\n\nWhen program is running, we call that **the process**: the unit of program running on OS, one program not only have one processes.\n\nWhen program need call devices, we need driver. Avoid each program making a separate implementation for each device. the same devices types, they have the same interface design on OS driver.\n\n**KERNEL MODE** and **USER MODE**: for isolation, the processes cannot access the device directly, these mode exist implementation in the CPU. A program that runs in kernel mode and is not called by normal user processes is called a **kernel**.\n\n**SYSTEM CALL** : the process call the devices driver (or kernel features).\n\nKernel's main features:\n- Processes management (scheduler);\n- Memeory management;\n- File system features;\n- System call API;\n- Devices driver;\n\n## CHAPTER 2: USER MODE FEATURES\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T09:38:04.772182685Z","tags":null},"/2023-01-08":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T09:38:04.720182153Z","tags":null}}
