(before 2018 I used wordpress for [my old blog site](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105093233/https://linux.dog/) ...  ) At that time, Im a ~~full-stack developer~~ (not real just node.js user). We love everthing on node.js runtime, npm, and other things. That's easy way to use the `yarn` get everything.\nI've been following the trendy stuff, ignore actually write sth. I hope my blog able to really build up some knowledge for me.\n\nI thought HEXO had been good until I started working for [meta.io (2021-2022)](https://github.com/Meta-Network). They chose to use HEXO as a static site generator to generate sites from their \"User centre\", which was done to make static resources (deploy on chain) work better on Web3.\n\n\u003e I should clarify that Im just interested in web3 technology. Thats really an \"out-of-the-box\" resource provable system (I'm bullshitting, u must have a lot of objections).\n\nThe process of developing the HEXO plugin has led me to read a lot of source code, plugins, and most of them have not been maintained for a long time. It's hard to be timeless after being fashionable. Thats worries me, even though my blog is same not update ...\n\nBy chance I started using [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) as my knowledge tool. After that I heard about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and I started to experiment with it as a markdown tool. They r [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) firendly and can export the doc to HTML for a site. **So why not use those build my blog ?** \n\n## 🔍 Some research\nWe can found some HTML converter and generator tools search by Google. We need the publisher convert the Obsidian markdown document to HTML pages, and generate a site for publish. After sifting through them, I found publish solutions via jekyll or hugo, in addition to the official website generation service.\n- Jekyll: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template\n- Hugo: https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\nSo, I have created a \"workflow\" for note/blog posting. I opted for the hugo solution ... Changes were made to his [Github repo](https://github.com/u-u-z/back-yard-site) to create this site. The site content its in [another repo](https://github.com/u-u-z/back-yard-content). I make changes to my notes (things I want to publish) directly in Obsidian, and committing the commit triggers Github actions to package my site and update it to the Cloudflare pages service.

Request / Input by devices or networking.\n2. Read the program from RAM, execute on CPU, save results in RAM (part for save result).\n3. Save results to RAM or HDD/SSD storage, or send throw network devices, or output to device.\n4. repeat 1 ⬆️\n\nThese meaningful steps for user, we call that **the program**. There r Applications, middlewares, and OS program for users.\n\nWhen program is running, we call that **the process**: the unit of program running on OS, one program not only have one processes.\n\nWhen program need call devices, we need driver. Avoid each program making a separate implementation for each device. the same devices types, they have the same interface design on OS driver.\n\n**KERNEL MODE** and **USER MODE**: for isolation, the processes cannot access the device directly, these mode exist implementation in the CPU. A program that runs in kernel mode and is not called by normal user processes is called a **kernel**.\n\n**SYSTEM CALL** : the process call the devices driver (or kernel features).\n\nKernel's main features:\n- Processes management (scheduler);\n- Memeory management;\n- File system features;\n- System call API;\n- Devices driver;\n\n## CHAPTER 2: USER MODE FEATURES\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-25T12:05:28.264576537Z","tags":null},"/-MY-TOOL-COLLECTIONS":{"title":"🔧 MY TOOL COLLECTIONS","content":"\n\u003e updating ...\n\n## Terminal \u0026 Shell\n- 🐈 Kitty\n- 💻 OhMyZsh\n## Package manager\n- ❄️ Nix pkgs\n- 🍺 homebrew\n## Browser\n- Arc\n## Container\n- 🐳 Docker","lastmodified":"2023-04-25T12:05:28.264576537Z","tags":null}}
